 * - NUM: Represents numeric literals (e.g., single digit numbers).
 * - SOMA: Represents the addition operator ('+').
 * - MULT: Represents the multiplication operator ('*').
 * - APar: Represents the opening parenthesis ('(').
 * - FPar: Represents the closing parenthesis (')').
 * - EOF: Represents the end of the file/input stream.
